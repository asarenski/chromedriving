  - URL validation and normalization
  - Retry mechanisms for screenshot capture
  - Specific error types and status codes
  - Security validations for file access
  - Logging system for debugging and monitoring
- Makefile for build and run commands:
  - Setup and installation commands
  - Run commands for development and production
  - Cleanup commands
  - Screenshot management commands
  - Docker commands for build, run, and stop
- Docker containerization:
  - Dockerfile with Chromium, ChromeDriver, Tesseract, and Poppler
  - Non-root user configuration for security
  - Docker build, run, and stop commands in Makefile
  - .dockerignore file for optimized builds
  - Xvfb setup for headless browser operation
- Successfully resolved ChromeDriver setup issues in Docker environment

## What's In Progress

- Improving OCR integration with Tesseract
- Enhancing screenshot processing pipeline

## What's Left to Build

- Testing framework
- Comprehensive documentation
- Admin interface (if needed)

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of core functionality. The Flask server now includes a `/submit-url` endpoint that accepts POST requests with URLs and uses Selenium ChromeDriver to capture screenshots of the submitted webpage. Screenshots are stored in the assets directory with organized filenames based on domain and path. We've also implemented screenshot retrieval endpoints to allow users to list and access captured screenshots.

We've completed a comprehensive enhancement of the error handling system throughout the application. This includes URL validation and normalization, retry mechanisms for failed screenshot attempts, specific error types with appropriate HTTP status codes, security validations for file access, and a robust logging system. Cookie banner handling has been improved with more detection patterns and better error recovery. The application now gracefully handles edge cases like invalid URLs, slow-loading pages, and other common failure scenarios.

A Makefile has been created to simplify build and run commands for the application. It includes commands for setup, running the application in different modes, cleaning up files, and managing screenshots.

Docker containerization has been implemented with a Dockerfile that includes all necessary dependencies like Chromium, ChromeDriver, Tesseract, and Poppler. The Docker image is configured with appropriate permissions and runs as a non-root user for enhanced security. The Makefile has been updated with commands for building, running, and stopping the Docker container.

We've successfully implemented and fixed the ChromeDriver setup in the Docker environment, resolving the "Status code was: -5" error. The key improvements include:

- Using the Debian package manager to install compatible versions of Chromium and ChromeDriver
- Adding platform-specific configurations for both macOS and Linux environments
- Implementing better error handling and debugging for ChromeDriver initialization
- Configuring proper permissions for the ChromeDriver binary
- Adding environmental variables to ensure Chrome/Chromium binary paths are correctly identified

With these fixes, the system can now successfully capture screenshots of websites when running in the Docker container.

## Known Issues

- No testing framework in place

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial decision to use Python for implementation
- Choice of Tesseract for OCR capabilities
- Inclusion of PDF processing capabilities (using pdf2image and poppler)
- Decision to use Flask as the web server framework
- Implementation of JSON-based API for URL submission
- Selection of Selenium for browser automation and screenshot capture
- Use of file system for screenshot storage with organized naming conventions
- Added RESTful API endpoints for screenshot retrieval
- Enhanced error handling with retry mechanisms and specific error types
- Implemented Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- Successfully transitioned from Google Chrome to Chromium for better compatibility
- Fixed ChromeDriver issues in Docker environment by using system packages and proper configuration
